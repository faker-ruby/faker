    # Given a `Binding` from inside a method and a 'seed' Pry::Method object,
    # there are primarily two situations where the seed method doesn't match
    # the Binding:
    # 1. The Pry::Method is from a subclass 2. The Pry::Method represents a method of the same name
    # while the original was renamed to something else. For 1. we
    # search vertically up the inheritance chain,
    # and for 2. we search laterally along the object's method table.
    #
    # When we locate the method that matches the Binding we wrap it in
    # Pry::Method and return it, or return nil if we fail.
