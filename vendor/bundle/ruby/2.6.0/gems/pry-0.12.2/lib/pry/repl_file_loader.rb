class Pry
  # A class to manage the loading of files through the REPL loop.
  # This is an interesting trick as it processes your file as if it
  # was user input in an interactive session. As a result, all Pry
  # commands are available, and they are executed non-interactively. Furthermore
  # the session becomes interactive when the repl loop processes a
  # 'make-interactive' command in the file. The session also becomes
  # interactive when an exception is encountered, enabling you to fix
  # the error before returning to non-interactive processing with the
  # 'make-non-interactive' command.
