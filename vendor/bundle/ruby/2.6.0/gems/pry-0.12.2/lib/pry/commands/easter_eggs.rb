  Now the light falls
  Across the open field, leaving the deep lane
  Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,
  Where you lean against a bank while a van passes,
  And the deep lane insists on the direction
  Into the village, in the electric heat
  Hypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light
  Is absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.
  The dahlias sleep in the empty silence.
  Wait for the early owl.

  When this American woman,
  whose thighs are bound in casual red cloth,
  comes thundering past my sitting place
  like a forest-burning Mongol tribe,
  the city is ravished
  and brittle buildings of a hundred years
  splash into the street;
  and my eyes are burnt
  for the embroidered Chinese girls,
  already old,
  and so small between the thin pines
  on these enormous landscapes,
  that if you turn your head
  they are lost for hours.

  I've gone to bed with every feeling,
  I've been the pimp of every emotion,
  All felt sensations have bought me drinks,
  I've traded glances with every motive for every act,
  I've held hands with every urge to depart,
  ..
  Rage, foam, the vastness that doesn't fit in my handkerchief,
  The dog in heat howling in the night,
  The pond from the farm going in circles around my insomnia,
  The woods as they were, on our late-afternoon walks, the rose,
  The indifferent tuft of hair, the moss, the pines,
  The rage of not containing all this, not retaining all this,
  O abstract hunger for things, impotent libido for moments,
  Intellectual orgy of feeling life!
                -- Fernando Pessoa
