### HEAD

### [v0.12.2][v0.12.2] (November 12, 2018)

#### Bug fixes

* Restore removed deprecations, which were removed by accident due to a bad
  rebase.

### [v0.12.1][v0.12.1] (November 12, 2018)

#### Bug fixes

* Stopped creating a new hash each time `Pry::Prompt#[]` is invoked
  ([#1855](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1855))
* Fixed `less` pager not working when it's available
  ([#1861](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1861))

### [v0.12.0][v0.12.0] (November 5, 2018)

#### Major changes

* Dropped support for Rubinius ([#1785](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1785))

#### Features

* Added a new command, `clear-screen`, that clears the content of the screen Pry
  is running in regardless of platform (Windows or UNIX-like)
  ([#1723](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1723))
* Added a new command, `gem-stat`, that prints gem statistics such as gem
  dependencies and downloads ([#1707](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1707))
* Added support for nested exceptions for the `wtf` command
  ([#1791](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1791))
* Added support for dynamic prompt names
  ([#1833](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1833))

  ```rb
  # pryrc
  Pry.config.prompt_name = Pry.lazy { rand(100) }

  # Session
  [1] 80(main)>
  [2] 87(main)>
  [3] 30(main)>
  ```
* Added support for XDG Base Directory Specification
  ([#1609](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1609),
  [#1844](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1844),
  ([#1848](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1848)))
* Removed the `simple-prompt`. Use `change-prompt simple` instead. The
  `list-prompt` command was removed and embedded as `change-prompt --list`
  ([#1849](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1849))

#### API changes

* The following methods started accepting the new optional `config` parameter
  ([#1809](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1809)):
  * `Pry::Helpers.tablify(things, line_length, config = Pry.config)`
  * `Pry::Helpers.tablify_or_one_line(heading, things, config = Pry.config)`
  * `Pry::Helpers.tablify_to_screen_width(things, options, config = Pry.config)`
  * `Pry::Helpers::Table.new(items, args, config = Pry.config)`

  You are expected to pass a session-local `_pry_.config` instead of the global
  one.

* Added new method `Pry::Config.assign`, for creating a Config non-recursively
  ([#1725](https://github.com/pry/pry/issues/1725))
* Added `Pry.lazy`, which is a helper method for values that need to be
  calculated dynamically. Currently, only `config.prompt_name` supports it
  ([#1833](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1833))
* `Pry::Prompt` responds to `.[]`, `.all` & `.add` now. The `Pry::Prompt.add`
  method must be used for implementing custom prompts. See the API in the
  documentation for the class ([#1846](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1846))

#### Breaking changes

* Deleted the `Pry::Helpers::Text.bright_default` alias for
  `Pry::Helpers::Text.bold` ([#1795](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1795))
* `Pry::Helpers.tablify_to_screen_width(things, options, config = Pry.config)`
  requires `options` or `nil` in place of them.
* `Pry::Helpers::Table.new(items, args, config = Pry.config)` requires `args`
  or `nil` in place of them.
* Completely revamped `Pry::HistoryArray`
  ([#1818](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1818)).
  * It's been renamed to `Pry::Ring`
    ([#1817](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1817))
  * The implementation has changed and as result, the following methods were
    removed:
    * `Pry::Ring#length` (use `Pry::Ring#count` instead)
    * `#empty?`, `#each`, `#inspect`, `#pop!`, `#to_h`
  * To access old Enumerable methods convert the ring to Array with `#to_a`
  * Fixed indexing for elements (e.g. `_pry_.input_ring[0]` always return some
    element and not `nil`)
* Renamed `Pry.config.prompt_safe_objects` to `Pry.config.prompt_safe_contexts`
* Removed deprecated `Pry::CommandSet#before_command` &
  `Pry::CommandSet#after_command` ([#1838](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1838))

#### Deprecations

* Deprecated `_pry_.input_array` & `_pry_.output_array` in favour of
  `_pry_.input_ring` & `_pry_.output_ring` respectively
  ([#1814](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1814))
* Deprecated `Pry::Command#text`. Please use `#black`, `#white`, etc. directly
  instead (as you would with helper functions from `BaseHelpers` and
  `CommandHelpers`) ([#1701](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1701))
* Deprecated `_pry_.input_array` & `_pry_.output_array` in favour of
  `_pry_.input_ring` and `_pry_.output_ring` respectively
  ([#1817](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1817))
* Deprecated `Pry::Platform`. Use `Pry::Helpers::Platform` instead. Note that
  `Pry::Helpers::BaseHelpers` still includes the `Platform` methods but emits a
  warning. You must switch to `Pry::Helpers::Platform` in your code
  ([#1838](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1838),
  ([#1845](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1845)))
* Deprecated `Pry::Prompt::MAP`. You should use `Pry::Prompt.all` instead to
  access the same map ([#1846](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1846))

#### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug where `cd Hash.new` reported `self` as an instance of Pry::Config
  in the prompt ([#1725](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1725))
* Silenced the `Could not find files for the given pattern(s)` error message
  coming from `where` on Windows, when `less` or another pager is not installed
  ([#1767](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1767))
* Fixed possible double loading of Pry plugins' `cli.rb` on Ruby (>= 2.4) due to
  [the `realpath` changes while invoking
  `require`](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10222)
  ([#1762](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1762),
  [#1774](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1762))
* Fixed `NoMethodError` on code objects that have a comment but no source when
  invoking `show-source` ([#1779](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1779))
* Fixed `negative argument (ArgumentError)` upon pasting code with tabs, which
  used to confuse automatic indentation
  ([#1771](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1771))
* Fixed Pry not being able to load history on Ruby 2.4.4+ when it contains the
  null character ([#1789](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1789))
* Fixed Pry raising errors on `cd`'ing into some objects that redefine
  `method_missing` and `respond_to?`
  ([#1811](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1811))
* Fixed bug when indentation leaves parts of input after pressing enter when
  Readline is enabled with mode indicators for vi mode
  ([#1813](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1813),
  [#1820](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1820),
  [#1825](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1825))
* Fixed `edit` not writing to history
  ([#1749](https://github.com/pry/pry/issues/1749))

#### Other changes

* Deprecated the `Data` constant to match Ruby 2.5 in the `ls` command
  ([#1731](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1731))

### 0.11.3

      pry(main)> d.method(:exception_whitelist=) # Error

See pull request [#1688](https://github.com/pry/pry/pull/1688).

* Do not capture unused Proc objects in Text helper methods `no_color` and `no_paging`,
  for performance reasons. Improve the documentation of both methods.

  logic for guessing what path to require. (#1188)
* `toggle-color` command toggles the local `_pry_.color` setting instead of the

#### Dev-facing changes
* `CommandSet#commands`, sometimes referenced through `Pry.commands.commands`,
  renamed to `CommandSet#to_hash`. It returns a duplicate of the internal hash
  a CommandSet uses.
* `CommandSet#keys` is now an alias of `CommandSet#list_commands`.
* All commands should now reference configuration values via `_pry_.config`
  (local) and not `Pry.config` (global). (#1096)
  * This change improves support for concurrent environments and
    context-specific Pry sessions. `_pry_.config` inherits default values from
    `Pry.config` but can override them locally.
* `rake pry` now accepts switches prefixed with `_` (e.g., `rake pry _v`)
* Pagers now act like `IO`s and accept streaming output
  * See `_pry_.pager.page` and `_pry_.pager.open`.
* The `Pry` class has been broken up into two smaller classes.
  * `Pry` represents non-UI-specific session state, including the eval string
  * `Pry::REPL` controls the user-facing interface
  * This should make it easier to drive Pry from alternative interfaces
  * `Pry.start` now has a `:driver` option that defaults to `Pry::REPL`
  * This involved a lot of refactoring and may break plugins that depend on
    the old layout
* Add `ColorPrinter` subclass of `PP` for colorized object inspection
* Add `[]` and `[]=` methods to `CommandSet`, which find and replace commands
  * Example: `Pry.commands["help"] = MyHelpCommand`
* The completion API has been refactored (see fdb703a8de4ef3)
* `Pry.config.input_stack` (and the input stack concept in general) no longer
  exists
* There's a new `Pry::Terminal` class that implements a number of different
  methods of determining the terminal's dimensions
* Add `ReplTester` class for high-level simulation of Pry sessions in tests
* Add `Pry.main`. Returns the special instance of Object referenced by self of
  `TOPLEVEL_BINDING`: "main".
* Changed second argument of `Pry.view_clip()` from Fixnum to Hash to support
  returning a string with or without a hex representation of object ID. (#1162)
* The `output` and `pager` objects will now strip color-codes, so commands should
  always print in color.
* Commands now have a `state` hash that is persistent across invocations of the command
  in the same pry session.

### 0.9.11.1 (2013/01/16)
* Fix minor bug in `gist` command where I neglected to remove

* edit-method can now edit REPL-defined methods
* cat --ex now works on exceptions in REPL-defined code

* input_stack now implemented - pushing objects onto a pry instance's input_stack causes the instance to read from those objects in turn as it encounters EOF on the previous object.

MAJOR NEW FEATURES:
- JRuby support, including show-method/edit-method and editor integration on both 1.8 and 1.9 versions

- play command now works much better with _in_ array (this is a very powerful feature, esp with Pry::NAV_PROMPT)
- history saving/loading is now lightning fast
- 'edit' (entered by itself) now opens current lines in input buffer in an editor, and evals on exit
- 'edit' command is also, in general more intelligent
- ls output no longer in array format, and colors can be configured, e.g: Pry.config.ls.ivar_color = :bright_blue
- new switch-to command for moving around the binding stack without exiting out of sessions
- more sophisticated prompts, Pry::NAV_PROMPT to ease deep spelunking of code
- major bug fix for windows systems
- much better support for huge objects, should no longer hang pry (see #245)
- cat --ex and edit --ex now work better

complete CHANGELOG:

* 'cd ..' just pops a binding off the binding_stack with special behaviour when only one binding in stack - it breaks out of the repl loop
* added switch-to command (like jump-to but doesn't unwind the stack)
* show-method and show-doc now accept multiple method names
* control_d hook added (Pry.config.control_d_handler)
* behaviour of ^d is now to break out of current expr if in multi-line expr, or break out of current context if nested, or break out of pry repl loop if at top-level

* ^C no longer captured
* got rid of Pry.active_instance, Pry.last_exception and friends.
* also special locals now shared among bindings in a pry instance (i.e _ex_ (and friends) re-injected into new binding entered with 'cd')
* renamed inp and out to _in_ and _out_ (to avoid collisions with actual locals in debugging scope)
* added third parameter to prompts, the pry instance itself (_pry) see https://github.com/pry/pry/issues/233 for why it's important
* cd behaviour when no args performs the same as `cd /`
* commands with keep_retval can now return nil (to suppress output now return 'void' instead)
* Pry::CommandProcessor::Result introduced
* Pry.view_clip() modified to be more robust and properly display Class#name
* edit command when invoked with no args now works like edit -t
* when edit is invoked (with no args or with -t) inside a multi-line expression input buffer, it dumps that buffer into a temp file and takes you to it
* got rid of Pry#null_input? since all that was needed was eval_string.empty?
* cd command now supports complex syntax: cd ../@y/y/../z
* JRuby is no longer a 2nd class citizen, almost full JRuby support, passing 100% tests
* added Pry::NAV_PROMPT (great new navigation prompt, per robgleeson) and Pry::SIMPLE_PRINT for simple (IRB-style) print output (just using inspect)
* _pry_ now passed as 3rd parameter to :before_session hook
* ls colors now configurable via Pry.config.ls.local_var_color = :bright_red etc
* ls separator configurable via, e.g Pry.config.ls.separator = "  "
* Pry.view_clip() now only calls inspect on a few immediates, otherwise uses the #<> syntax, which has been truncated further to exclude teh mem address, again related to #245

### 0.9.3 (2011/7/27)
* cat --ex (cats 5 lines above and below line in file where exception was raised)
* edit --ex (edits line in file where exception was raised)
* edit -t (opens a temporary file and evals it in current context when closed)
* `pry -r` requires now happen after plugin loading (so as not to interfere with
* new Pry.config.disable_auto_reload option, for turning off auto reloading by edit-method and related (thanks ryanf)
* add better error messages for `cd` command
* fixed exotic object regression - BasicObject.new etc now return "=> unknown"
* added reload-method command (reloads the associated file of a method)
* converted: import => import-set, version => pry-version, install => install-command
* Pry.config.command_prefix support (thanks ryanf!)
* fixed indentation for simple-prompt
* hist command now excludes last line of input (the command invocation itself)
* hist now has `history` alias
* missing plugins no longer raise exception, just print a warning to $stderr
* fixed jedit editor support
