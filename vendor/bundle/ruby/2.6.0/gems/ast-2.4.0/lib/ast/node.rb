module AST
  # Node is an immutable class, instances of which represent abstract
  # syntax tree nodes. It combines semantic information (i.e. anything
  # that affects the algorithmic properties of a program) with
  # meta-information (line numbers or compiler intermediates).
  #
  # Notes on inheritance
  # ====================
  #
  # The distinction between semantics and metadata is important. Complete
  # semantic information should be contained within just the {#type} and
  # {#children} of a Node instance; in other words, if an AST was to be
  # stripped of all meta-information, it should remain a valid AST which
  # could be successfully processed to yield a result with the same
  # algorithmic properties.
  #
  # Thus, Node should never be inherited in order to define methods which
  # affect or return semantic information, such as getters for `class_name`,
  # `superclass` and `body` in the case of a hypothetical `ClassNode`. The
  # correct solution is to use a generic Node with a {#type} of `:class`
  # and three children. See also {Processor} for tips on working with such
  # ASTs.
  #
  # On the other hand, Node can and should be inherited to define
  # application-specific metadata (see also {#initialize}) or customize the
  # printing format. It is expected that an application would have one or two
  # such classes and use them across the entire codebase.
  #
  # The rationale for this pattern is extensibility and maintainability.
  # Unlike static ones, dynamic languages do not require the presence of a
  # predefined, rigid structure, nor does it improve dispatch efficiency,
  # and while such a structure can certainly be defined, it does not add
  # any value but incurs a maintaining cost.
  # For example, extending the AST even with a transformation-local
  # temporary node type requires making globally visible changes to
  # the codebase.
  #
  class Node
    # Returns the type of this node.
    # @return [Symbol]
    attr_reader :type

    # Returns the children of this node.
    # The returned value is frozen.
    # The to_a alias is useful for decomposing nodes concisely.
    # For example:
    #
    #     node = s(:gasgn, :$foo, s(:integer, 1))
    #     var_name, value = *node
    #     p var_name # => :$foo
    #     p value    # => (integer 1)
    #
    # @return [Array]
    attr_reader :children
    alias to_a children

    # Returns the precomputed hash value for this node
    # @return [Fixnum]
    attr_reader :hash

    # Constructs a new instance of Node.
    #
    # The arguments `type` and `children` are converted with `to_sym` and
    # `to_a` respectively. Additionally, the result of converting `children`
    # is frozen. While mutating the arguments is generally considered harmful,
    # the most common case is to pass an array literal to the constructor. If
    # your code does not expect the argument to be frozen, use `#dup`.
    #
    # The `properties` hash is passed to {#assign_properties}.
