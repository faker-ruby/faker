  - Pure Ruby implementation for everything else
  - Effects `Concurrent.timer`, `Concurrent.timeout`, `TimerSet`, `TimerTask`, and `ScheduledTask`
* Deprecated all clock-time based timer scheduling
  - Only support scheduling by delay
  - Effects `Concurrent.timer`, `TimerSet`, and `ScheduledTask`
* Added new `ReadWriteLock` class
* Consistent `at_exit` behavior for Java and Ruby thread pools.
* Added `at_exit` handler to Ruby thread pools (already in Java thread pools)
  - Ruby handler stores the object id and retrieves from `ObjectSpace`
  - JRuby disables `ObjectSpace` by default so that handler stores the object reference
* Added a `:stop_on_exit` option to thread pools to enable/disable `at_exit` handler
* Updated thread pool docs to better explain shutting down thread pools
* Simpler `:executor` option syntax for all abstractions which support this option
* Added `Executor#auto_terminate?` predicate method (for thread pools)

* Simplified auto-termination of the global executors
* Deprecated terms "task pool" and "operation pool"
  - New terms are "io executor" and "fast executor"
  - New functions added with new names
  - Deprecation warnings added to functions referencing old names
* Moved all thread pool related functions from `Concurrent::Configuration` to `Concurrent`
  - Old functions still exist with deprecation warnings
  - New functions have updated names as appropriate
* All high-level abstractions default to the "io executor"
* Fixed bug in `Actor` causing it to prematurely warm global thread pools on gem load
  - This also fixed a `RejectedExecutionError` bug when running with minitest/autorun via JRuby
* Moved global logger up to the `Concurrent` namespace and refactored the code
* Optimized the performance of `Delay`
  - Fixed a bug in which no executor option on construction caused block execution on a global thread pool
* Numerous improvements and bug fixes to `TimerSet`
* Fixed deadlock of `Future` when the handler raises Exception
* Added shared specs for more classes
* New concurrency abstractions including:
  - `Atom`
  - `Maybe`
  - `ImmutableStruct`
  - `MutableStruct`
  - `SettableStruct`
* Created an Edge gem for unstable abstractions including
  - `Actor`
  - `Agent`
  - `Channel`
  - `Exchanger`
  - `LazyRegister`
  - **new Future Framework** <http://ruby-concurrency.github.io/concurrent-ruby/Concurrent/Edge.html> - unified
    implementation of Futures and Promises which combines Features of previous `Future`,
    `Promise`, `IVar`, `Event`, `Probe`, `dataflow`, `Delay`, `TimerTask` into single framework. It uses extensively
    new synchronization layer to make all the paths **lock-free** with exception of blocking threads on `#wait`.
    It offers better performance and does not block threads when not required.
* Actor framework changes:
  - fixed reset loop in Pool
  - Pool can use any actor as a worker, abstract worker class is no longer needed.
  - Actor events not have format `[:event_name, *payload]` instead of just the Symbol.
  - Actor now uses new Future/Promise Framework instead of `IVar` for better interoperability
  - Behaviour definition array was simplified to `[BehaviourClass1, [BehaviourClass2, *initialization_args]]`
  - Linking behavior responds to :linked message by returning array of linked actors
  - Supervised behavior is removed in favour of just Linking
  - RestartingContext is supervised by default now, `supervise: true` is not required any more
  - Events can be private and public, so far only difference is that Linking will
    pass to linked actors only public messages. Adding private :restarting and
    :resetting events which are send before the actor restarts or resets allowing
    to add callbacks to cleanup current child actors.
  - Print also object_id in Reference to_s
  - Add AbstractContext#default_executor to be able to override executor class wide
  - Add basic IO example
  - Documentation somewhat improved
  - All messages should have same priority. It's now possible to send `actor << job1 << job2 << :terminate!` and
    be sure that both jobs are processed first.
* Refactored `Channel` to use newer synchronization objects
* Added `#reset` and `#cancel` methods to `TimerSet`
* Added `#cancel` method to `Future` and `ScheduledTask`
* Refactored `TimerSet` to use `ScheduledTask`

* C native `CAtomicFixnum`
* Refactored intermittently failing tests
* Added `dataflow!` and `dataflow_with!` methods to match `Future#value!` method
* Better handling of timeout in `Agent`
* Actor Improvements
  - Fine-grained implementation using chain of behaviors. Each behavior is responsible for single aspect like: `Termination`, `Pausing`, `Linking`, `Supervising`, etc. Users can create custom Actors easily based on their needs.
  - Supervision was added. `RestartingContext` will pause on error waiting on its supervisor to decide what to do next ( options are `:terminate!`, `:resume!`, `:reset!`, `:restart!`). Supervising behavior also supports strategies `:one_for_one` and `:one_for_all`.
  - Linking was added to be able to monitor actor's events like: `:terminated`, `:paused`, `:restarted`, etc.
  - Dead letter routing added. Rejected envelopes are collected in a configurable actor (default: `Concurrent::Actor.root.ask!(:dead_letter_routing)`)
  - Old `Actor` class removed and replaced by new implementation previously called `Actress`. `Actress` was kept as an alias for `Actor` to keep compatibility.
  - `Utils::Broadcast` actor which allows Publish–subscribe pattern.
* More executors for managing serialized operations
  - `SerializedExecution` mixin module
  - `SerializedExecutionDelegator` for serializing *any* executor
* Updated `Async` with serialized execution
* Updated `ImmediateExecutor` and `PerThreadExecutor` with full executor service lifecycle
* Added a `Delay` to root `Actress` initialization
* Minor bug fixes to thread pools
* Refactored many intermittently failing specs
* Removed Java interop warning `executor.rb:148 warning: ambiguous Java methods found, using submit(java.lang.Runnable)`

* All thread pools now extend the appropriate thread pool executor classes

* Added `Concurrent::dataflow_with(executor, *inputs)` method to support executor dependency injection for dataflow
* Software transactional memory with `TVar` and `Concurrent::atomically`
* First implementation of [new, high-performance](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/pull/49) `Channel`
* `Actor` is deprecated in favor of new experimental actor implementation [#73](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby/pull/73). To avoid namespace collision it is living in `Actress` namespace until `Actor` is removed in next release.
