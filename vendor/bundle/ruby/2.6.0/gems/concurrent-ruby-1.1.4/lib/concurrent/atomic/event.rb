module Concurrent

  # Old school kernel-style event reminiscent of Win32 programming in C++.
  #
  # When an `Event` is created it is in the `unset` state. Threads can choose to
  # `#wait` on the event, blocking until released by another thread. When one
  # thread wants to alert all blocking threads it calls the `#set` method which
  # will then wake up all listeners. Once an `Event` has been set it remains set.
  # New threads calling `#wait` will return immediately. An `Event` may be
  # `#reset` at any time once it has been set.
  #

  # @example
  #   event = Concurrent::Event.new
  #
  #   t1 = Thread.new do
  #     puts "t1 is waiting"
  #     event.wait(1)
  #     puts "event ocurred"
  #   end
  #
  #   t2 = Thread.new do
  #     puts "t2 calling set"
  #     event.set
  #   end
  #
  #   [t1, t2].each(&:join)
  #
  #   # prints:
  #   # t2 calling set
  #   # t1 is waiting
  #   # event occurred
