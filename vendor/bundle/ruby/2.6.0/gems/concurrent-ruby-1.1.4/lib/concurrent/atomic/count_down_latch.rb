  #   Block on the latch until the counter reaches zero or until `timeout` is reached.

  #   @param [Fixnum] timeout the number of seconds to wait for the counter or `nil`
  #     to block indefinitely

  #
  #   Signal the latch to decrement the counter. Will signal all blocked threads when

  # @!macro count_down_latch_method_count
  #
  #   The current value of the counter.

  # @!macro count_down_latch
  #
  #   A synchronization object that allows one thread to wait on multiple other threads.
  #   The thread that will wait creates a `CountDownLatch` and sets the initial value
  #   (normally equal to the number of other threads). The initiating thread passes the
  #   latch to the other threads then waits for the other threads by calling the `#wait`
  #   method. Each of the other threads calls `#count_down` when done with its work.
  #   When the latch counter reaches zero the waiting thread is unblocked and continues
  #   with its work. A `CountDownLatch` can be used only once. Its value cannot be reset.
  #
  # @!macro count_down_latch_public_api
  # @example Waiter and Decrementer
  #   latch = Concurrent::CountDownLatch.new(3)
  #
  #   waiter = Thread.new do
  #     latch.wait()

  #   decrementer = Thread.new do
  #     sleep(1)
  #     latch.count_down
  #     puts latch.count
  #
  #     sleep(1)
  #     latch.count_down
  #     puts latch.count
  #
  #     sleep(1)
