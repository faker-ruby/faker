  # A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for each
  # other to reach a common barrier point.
  # @example
  #   barrier = Concurrent::CyclicBarrier.new(3)
  #   jobs    = Array.new(3) { |i| -> { sleep i; p done: i } }
  #   process = -> (i) do
  #     # waiting to start at the same time
  #     barrier.wait
  #     # execute job
  #     jobs[i].call
  #     # wait for others to finish
  #     barrier.wait
  #   end
  #   threads = 2.times.map do |i|
  #     Thread.new(i, &process)
  #   end
  #
  #   # use main as well
  #   process.call 2
  #
  #   # here we can be sure that all jobs are processed
