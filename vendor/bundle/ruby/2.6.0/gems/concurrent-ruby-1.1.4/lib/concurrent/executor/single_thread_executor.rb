  # @!macro single_thread_executor
  #
  #   A thread pool with a single thread an unlimited queue. Should the thread
  #   die for any reason it will be removed and replaced, thus ensuring that
  #   the executor will always remain viable and available to process jobs.
  #
  #   A common pattern for background processing is to create a single thread
  #   on which an infinite loop is run. The thread's loop blocks on an input
  #   source (perhaps blocking I/O or a queue) and processes each input as it
  #   is received. This pattern has several issues. The thread itself is highly
  #   susceptible to errors during processing. Also, the thread itself must be
  #   constantly monitored and restarted should it die. `SingleThreadExecutor`
  #   encapsulates all these bahaviors. The task processor is highly resilient
  #   to errors from within tasks. Also, should the thread die it will
  #   automatically be restarted.
  #
  #   The API and behavior of this class are based on Java's `SingleThreadExecutor`.
