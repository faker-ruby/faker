  # An `MVar` is a synchronized single element container. They are empty or
  # contain one item. Taking a value from an empty `MVar` blocks, as does
  # putting a value into a full one. You can either think of them as blocking
  # queue of length one, or a special kind of mutable variable.
  #
  # On top of the fundamental `#put` and `#take` operations, we also provide a
  # `#mutate` that is atomic with respect to operations on the same instance.
  # These operations all support timeouts.
  #
  # We also support non-blocking operations `#try_put!` and `#try_take!`, a
  # `#set!` that ignores existing values, a `#value` that returns the value
  # without removing it or returns `MVar::EMPTY`, and a `#modify!` that yields
  # `MVar::EMPTY` if the `MVar` is empty and can be used to set `MVar::EMPTY`.
  # You shouldn't use these operations in the first instance.
  #
  # `MVar` is a [Dereferenceable](Dereferenceable).
  #
  # `MVar` is related to M-structures in Id, `MVar` in Haskell and `SyncVar` in Scala.
  #
  # Note that unlike the original Haskell paper, our `#take` is blocking. This is how
  # Haskell and Scala do it today.
