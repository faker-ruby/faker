#
#   ## Thread-safe Variable Classes
#
#   Each of the thread-safe variable classes is designed to solve a different
#   problem. In general:
#
#   * *{Concurrent::Agent}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#     uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#     the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result
#     of an update does not need to be known immediately.
#   * *{Concurrent::Atom}:* Shared, mutable variable providing independent,
#     uncoordinated, *synchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
#     the value will undergo frequent reads but only occasional, though complex,
#     updates. Suitable when the result of an update must be known immediately.
#   * *{Concurrent::AtomicReference}:* A simple object reference that can be
#     atomically. Updates are synchronous but fast. Best used when updates a
#     simple set operations. Not suitable when updates are complex.
#     {Concurrent::AtomicBoolean} and {Concurrent::AtomicFixnum} are similar
#     but optimized for the given data type.
#   * *{Concurrent::Exchanger}:* Shared, stateless synchronization point. Used
#     when two or more threads need to exchange data. The threads will pair then
#     block on each other until the exchange is complete.
#   * *{Concurrent::MVar}:* Shared synchronization point. Used when one thread
#     must give a value to another, which must take the value. The threads will
#     block on each other until the exchange is complete.
#   * *{Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar}:* Shared, mutable, isolated variable which
#     holds a different value for each thread which has access. Often used as
#     an instance variable in objects which must maintain different state
#     for different threads.
#   * *{Concurrent::TVar}:* Shared, mutable variables which provide
#     *coordinated*, *synchronous*, change of *many* stated. Used when multiple
#     value must change together, in an all-or-nothing transaction.


module Concurrent

  # Atoms provide a way to manage shared, synchronous, independent state.
  #
  # An atom is initialized with an initial value and an optional validation
  # proc. At any time the value of the atom can be synchronously and safely
  # changed. If a validator is given at construction then any new value
  # will be checked against the validator and will be rejected if the
  # validator returns false or raises an exception.
  #
  # There are two ways to change the value of an atom: {#compare_and_set} and
  # {#swap}. The former will set the new value if and only if it validates and
  # the current value matches the new value. The latter will atomically set the
  # new value to the result of running the given block if and only if that
  # value validates.
  #
  # ## Example
  #
  # ```
  # def next_fibonacci(set = nil)
  #   return [0, 1] if set.nil?
  #   set + [set[-2..-1].reduce{|sum,x| sum + x }]
  # end
  #
  # # create an atom with an initial value
  # atom = Concurrent::Atom.new(next_fibonacci)
  #
  # # send a few update requests
  # 5.times do
  #   atom.swap{|set| next_fibonacci(set) }
  # end
  #
  # # get the current value
  # atom.value #=> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
  # ```
  #
  # ## Observation
  #
  # Atoms support observers through the {Concurrent::Observable} mixin module.
  # Notification of observers occurs every time the value of the Atom changes.
  # When notified the observer will receive three arguments: `time`, `old_value`,
  # and `new_value`. The `time` argument is the time at which the value change
  # occurred. The `old_value` is the value of the Atom when the change began
  # The `new_value` is the value to which the Atom was set when the change
  # completed. Note that `old_value` and `new_value` may be the same. This is
  # not an error. It simply means that the change operation returned the same
  # value.
  #
  # Unlike in Clojure, `Atom` cannot participate in {Concurrent::TVar} transactions.
