  # @!macro concurrent_set
  #
  #   A thread-safe subclass of Set. This version locks against the object
  #   itself for every method call, ensuring only one thread can be reading
  #   or writing at a time. This includes iteration methods like `#each`.
  #
  #   @note `a += b` is **not** a **thread-safe** operation on
  #   `Concurrent::Set`. It reads Set `a`, then it creates new `Concurrent::Set`
  #   which is union of `a` and `b`, then it writes the union to `a`.
  #   The read and write are independent operations they do not form a single atomic
  #   operation therefore when two `+=` operations are executed concurrently updates
  #   may be lost. Use `#merge` instead.
