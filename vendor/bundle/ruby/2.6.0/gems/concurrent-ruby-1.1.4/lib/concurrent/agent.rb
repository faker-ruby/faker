  # `Agent` is inspired by Clojure's [agent](http://clojure.org/agents)
  # function. An agent is a shared, mutable variable providing independent,
  # uncoordinated, *asynchronous* change of individual values. Best used when
  # the value will undergo frequent, complex updates. Suitable when the result
  # of an update does not need to be known immediately. `Agent` is (mostly)
  # functionally equivalent to Clojure's agent, except where the runtime
  # prevents parity.
  #
  # Agents are reactive, not autonomous - there is no imperative message loop
  # and no blocking receive. The state of an Agent should be itself immutable
  # and the `#value` of an Agent is always immediately available for reading by
  # any thread without any messages, i.e. observation does not require
  # cooperation or coordination.
  #
  # Agent action dispatches are made using the various `#send` methods. These
  # methods always return immediately. At some point later, in another thread,
  # the following will happen:
  #
  # 1. The given `action` will be applied to the state of the Agent and the
  #    `args`, if any were supplied.
  # 2. The return value of `action` will be passed to the validator lambda,
  #    if one has been set on the Agent.
  # 3. If the validator succeeds or if no validator was given, the return value
  #    of the given `action` will become the new `#value` of the Agent. See
  #    `#initialize` for details.
  # 4. If any observers were added to the Agent, they will be notified. See
  #    `#add_observer` for details.
  # 5. If during the `action` execution any other dispatches are made (directly
  #    or indirectly), they will be held until after the `#value` of the Agent
  #    has been changed.
  #
  # If any exceptions are thrown by an action function, no nested dispatches
  # will occur, and the exception will be cached in the Agent itself. When an
  # Agent has errors cached, any subsequent interactions will immediately throw
  # an exception, until the agent's errors are cleared. Agent errors can be
  # examined with `#error` and the agent restarted with `#restart`.
  #
  # The actions of all Agents get interleaved amongst threads in a thread pool.
  # At any point in time, at most one action for each Agent is being executed.
  # Actions dispatched to an agent from another single agent or thread will
  # occur in the order they were sent, potentially interleaved with actions
  # dispatched to the same agent from other sources. The `#send` method should
  # be used for actions that are CPU limited, while the `#send_off` method is
  # appropriate for actions that may block on IO.
  #
  # Unlike in Clojure, `Agent` cannot participate in `Concurrent::TVar` transactions.
  #
  # ## Example
  #
  # ```
  # def next_fibonacci(set = nil)
  #   return [0, 1] if set.nil?
  #   set + [set[-2..-1].reduce{|sum,x| sum + x }]
  # end
  #
  # # create an agent with an initial value
  # agent = Concurrent::Agent.new(next_fibonacci)
  #
  # # send a few update requests
  # 5.times do
  #   agent.send{|set| next_fibonacci(set) }
  # end
  #
  # # wait for them to complete
  # agent.await
  #
  # # get the current value
  # agent.value #=> [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
  # ```
  #
  # ## Observation
  #
  # Agents support observers through the {Concurrent::Observable} mixin module.
  # Notification of observers occurs every time an action dispatch returns and
  # the new value is successfully validated. Observation will *not* occur if the
  # action raises an exception, if validation fails, or when a {#restart} occurs.
  #
  # When notified the observer will receive three arguments: `time`, `old_value`,
  # and `new_value`. The `time` argument is the time at which the value change
  # occurred. The `old_value` is the value of the Agent when the action began
  # processing. The `new_value` is the value to which the Agent was set when the
  # action completed. Note that `old_value` and `new_value` may be the same.
  # This is not an error. It simply means that the action returned the same
  # value.
  #
  # ## Nested Actions
  #
  # It is possible for an Agent action to post further actions back to itself.
  # The nested actions will be enqueued normally then processed *after* the
  # outer action completes, in the order they were sent, possibly interleaved
  # with action dispatches from other threads. Nested actions never deadlock
  # with one another and a failure in a nested action will never affect the
  # outer action.
  #
  # Nested actions can be called using the Agent reference from the enclosing
  # scope or by passing the reference in as a "send" argument. Nested actions
  # cannot be post using `self` from within the action block/proc/lambda; `self`
  # in this context will not reference the Agent. The preferred method for
  # dispatching nested actions is to pass the Agent as an argument. This allows
  # Ruby to more effectively manage the closing scope.
  #
  # Prefer this:
  #
  # ```
  # agent = Concurrent::Agent.new(0)
  # agent.send(agent) do |value, this|
  #   this.send {|v| v + 42 }
  #   3.14
  # end
  # agent.value #=> 45.14
  # ```
  #
  # Over this:
  #
  # ```
  # agent = Concurrent::Agent.new(0)
  # agent.send do |value|
  #   agent.send {|v| v + 42 }
  #   3.14
  # end
  # ```
  #
  # @!macro agent_await_warning
  #
  #   **NOTE** Never, *under any circumstances*, call any of the "await" methods
  #   ({#await}, {#await_for}, {#await_for!}, and {#wait}) from within an action
  #   block/proc/lambda. The call will block the Agent and will always fail.
  #   Calling either {#await} or {#wait} (with a timeout of `nil`) will
  #   hopelessly deadlock the Agent with no possibility of recovery.
