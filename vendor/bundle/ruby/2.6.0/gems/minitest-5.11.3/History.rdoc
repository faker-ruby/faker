Oh god... here we go...

Minitest 5:

* 4 deaths in the family:

  * MiniTest.runner is dead. No more manager objects.
  * MiniTest::Unit#record is dead. Use a Reporter instance instead.
  * MiniTest::Unit._run_* is dead. Runnable things are responsible for their own runs.
  * MiniTest::Unit.output is dead. No more centralized IO.

* 12 major (oft incompatible) changes:

  * Renamed MiniTest to Minitest. Your pinkies will thank me. (aliased to MiniTest)
  * Removed MiniTest::Unit entirely. No more manager objects.
  * Added Minitest::Runnable. Everything minitest can run subclasses this.
  * Renamed MiniTest::Unit::TestCase to Minitest::Test (subclassing Runnable).
  * Added Minitest::Benchmark.
    * Your benchmarks need to move to their own subclass.
    * Benchmarks using the spec DSL have to have "Bench" somewhere in their describe.
  * MiniTest::Unit.after_tests moved to Minitest.after_tests
  * MiniTest::Unit.autorun is now Minitest.autorun. Just require minitest/autorun pls.
  * Removed ParallelEach#grep since it isn't used anywhere.
  * Renamed Runnable#__name__ to Runnable#name (but uses @NAME internally).
  * Runnable#run needs to return self. Allows for swapping of results as needed.

* 8 minor moves:

  * Moved Assertions module to minitest/assertions.rb
  * Moved Expectations module to minitest/expectations.rb
  * Moved Test to minitest/test.rb
  * Moved everything else in minitest/unit.rb to minitest.rb
  * minitest/unit.rb is now just a small (user-test only) compatibility layer.
  * Moved most of minitest/pride into minitest/pride_plugin.
  * minitest/pride now just activates pride.
  * Moved ParallelEach under Minitest.

* 9 additions:

  * Added a plugin system that can extend command-line options.
  * Added Minitest.extensions.
  * Added Minitest.reporter (only available during startup).
  * Added Minitest.run(args). This is the very top of any Minitest run.
  * Added Minitest::Reporter. Everything minitest can report goes through here.
    * Minitest.reporter is a composite so you can add your own.
  * Added Minitest::CompositeReporter. Much easier to extend with your own reporters.
  * Added UnexpectedError, an Assertion subclass, to wrap up errors.
  * Minitest::Test#run is now freakin' beautiful. 47 -> 17 loc

* 11 other:

  * Removed Object.infect_with_assertions (it was already dead code).
  * Runnables are responsible for knowing their result_code (eg "." or "F").
  * Minitest.autorun now returns boolean, not exit code.
  * Added FAQ entry for extending via modules. (phiggins)
  * Implement Runnable#dup to cleanse state back to test results. Helps with serialization. pair:tenderlove
  * Moved ParallelEach under Minitest.
  * Runnable#run needs to return self. Allows for swapping of results as needed.
  * Minitest.init_plugins passes down options.
  * Minitest.load_plugins only loads once.

  * Added count/size to ParallelEach to fix use w/in stdlib's test/unit. :( (btaitelb)

  * Removed mutex from minitest.rb (phiggins)
  * Removed mutex from test.rb (phiggins)
  * Removed Minitest::Reporter.synchronize (phiggins)
  * Removed Minitest::Test.synchronize (phiggins)

=== 4.7.4 / 2013-05-01

This is probably the last release of the 4.x series. It will be merged
to ruby and will be put into maintenance mode there.

I'm not set in stone on this, but at this point further development of

ruby-core w/ test-unit compatibility holding minitest development
back.
