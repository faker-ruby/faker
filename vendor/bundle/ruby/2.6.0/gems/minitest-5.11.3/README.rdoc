== DESCRIPTION:

minitest provides a complete suite of testing facilities supporting
TDD, BDD, mocking, and benchmarking.

    "I had a class with Jim Weirich on testing last week and we were
     allowed to choose our testing frameworks. Kirk Haines and I were
     paired up and we cracked open the code for a few test
     frameworks...

     I MUST say that minitest is *very* readable / understandable
     compared to the 'other two' options we looked at. Nicely done and
     thank you for helping us keep our mental sanity."

    -- Wayne E. Seguin

minitest/test is a small and incredibly fast unit testing framework.
It provides a rich set of assertions to make your tests clean and
readable.

minitest/spec is a functionally complete spec engine. It hooks onto
minitest/test and seamlessly bridges test assertions over to spec
expectations.

minitest/benchmark is an awesome way to assert the performance of your
algorithms in a repeatable manner. Now you can assert that your newb
co-worker doesn't replace your linear algorithm with an exponential
one!

minitest/mock by Steven Baker, is a beautifully tiny mock (and stub)
object framework.

minitest/pride shows pride in testing and adds coloring to your test
output. I guess it is an example of how to write IO pipes too. :P

minitest/test is meant to have a clean implementation for language
implementors that need a minimal set of methods to bootstrap a working
test suite. For example, there is no magic involved for test-case
discovery.

    "Again, I can't praise enough the idea of a testing/specing
     framework that I can actually read in full in one sitting!"

    -- Piotr Szotkowski

Comparing to rspec:

    rspec is a testing DSL. minitest is ruby.

    -- Adam Hawkins, "Bow Before MiniTest"

minitest doesn't reinvent anything that ruby already provides, like:
classes, modules, inheritance, methods. This means you only have to
learn ruby to use minitest and all of your regular OO practices like
extract-method refactorings still apply.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* minitest/autorun - the easy and explicit way to run all your tests.
* minitest/test - a very fast, simple, and clean test system.
* minitest/spec - a very fast, simple, and clean spec system.
* minitest/mock - a simple and clean mock/stub system.
* minitest/benchmark - an awesome way to assert your algorithm's performance.
* minitest/pride - show your pride in testing!
* Incredibly small and fast runner, but no bells and whistles.
* Written by squishy human beings. Software can never be perfect. We will all eventually die.

== RATIONALE:

See design_rationale.rb to see how specs and tests work in minitest.

== SYNOPSIS:

Given that you'd like to test the following class:

  class Meme
    def i_can_has_cheezburger?
      "OHAI!"
    end

    def will_it_blend?
      "YES!"
    end
  end

=== Unit tests

Define your tests as methods beginning with +test_+.

  require "minitest/autorun"

  class TestMeme < Minitest::Test
    def setup
      @meme = Meme.new
    end

    def test_that_kitty_can_eat
      assert_equal "OHAI!", @meme.i_can_has_cheezburger?
    end

    def test_that_it_will_not_blend
      refute_match /^no/i, @meme.will_it_blend?
    end

    def test_that_will_be_skipped
      skip "test this later"
    end
  end

=== Specs

  require "minitest/autorun"

  describe Meme do
    before do
      @meme = Meme.new
    end

    describe "when asked about cheeseburgers" do
      it "must respond positively" do
        @meme.i_can_has_cheezburger?.must_equal "OHAI!"
      end
    end

    describe "when asked about blending possibilities" do
      it "won't say no" do
        @meme.will_it_blend?.wont_match /^no/i
      end
    end
  end

* https://github.com/rmm5t/minitest-matchers_vaccine

=== Benchmarks

Add benchmarks to your tests.

  # optionally run benchmarks, good for CI-only work!
  require "minitest/benchmark" if ENV["BENCH"]

  class TestMeme < Minitest::Benchmark
    # Override self.bench_range or default range is [1, 10, 100, 1_000, 10_000]
    def bench_my_algorithm
      assert_performance_linear 0.9999 do |n| # n is a range value
        @obj.my_algorithm(n)
      end
    end
  end

Or add them to your specs. If you make benchmarks optional, you'll
need to wrap your benchmarks in a conditional since the methods won't
be defined. In minitest 5, the describe name needs to match
<tt>/Bench(mark)?$/</tt>.

  describe "Meme Benchmark" do
    if ENV["BENCH"] then
      bench_performance_linear "my_algorithm", 0.9999 do |n|
        100.times do
          @obj.my_algorithm(n)
        end
      end
    end
  end

outputs something like:

  # Running benchmarks:

  TestBlah	100	1000	10000
  bench_my_algorithm	 0.006167	 0.079279	 0.786993
  bench_other_algorithm	 0.061679	 0.792797	 7.869932

Output is tab-delimited to make it easy to paste into a spreadsheet.

=== Mocks

Mocks and stubs defined using terminology by Fowler & Meszaros at
http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html:

"Mocks are pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification
of the calls they are expected to receive. They can throw an exception
if they receive a call they don't expect and are checked during
verification to ensure they got all the calls they were expecting."

  class MemeAsker
    def initialize(meme)
      @meme = meme
    end

    def ask(question)
      method = question.tr(" ", "_") + "?"
      @meme.__send__(method)
    end
  end

  require "minitest/autorun"

  describe MemeAsker, :ask do
    describe "when passed an unpunctuated question" do
      it "should invoke the appropriate predicate method on the meme" do
        @meme = Minitest::Mock.new
        @meme_asker = MemeAsker.new @meme
        @meme.expect :will_it_blend?, :return_value

        @meme_asker.ask "will it blend"

        @meme.verify
      end
    end
  end

**Multi-threading and Mocks**

Minitest mocks do not support multi-threading if it works, fine, if it doesn't
you can use regular ruby patterns and facilities like local variables. Here's
an example of asserting that code inside a thread is run:

  def test_called_inside_thread
    called = false
    pr = Proc.new { called = true }
    thread = Thread.new(&pr)
    thread.join
    assert called, "proc not called"
  end

=== Stubs

Mocks and stubs are defined using terminology by Fowler & Meszaros at
http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html:

"Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test".

Minitest's stub method overrides a single method for the duration of
the block.

  def test_stale_eh
    obj_under_test = Something.new

    refute obj_under_test.stale?

    Time.stub :now, Time.at(0) do   # stub goes away once the block is done
      assert obj_under_test.stale?
    end
  end

A note on stubbing: In order to stub a method, the method must
actually exist prior to stubbing. Use a singleton method to create a
new non-existing method:

  def obj_under_test.fake_method
    ...
  end

=== Running Your Tests

Ideally, you'll use a rake task to run your tests, either piecemeal or
all at once. Both rake and rails ship with rake tasks for running your
tests. BUT! You don't have to:

    % ruby -Ilib:test test/minitest/test_minitest_test.rb
    Run options: --seed 37685

    # Running:

    ...................................................................... (etc)

    Finished in 0.107130s, 1446.8403 runs/s, 2959.0217 assertions/s.

    155 runs, 317 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips

There are runtime options available, both from minitest itself, and also
provided via plugins. To see them, simply run with +--help+:

    % ruby -Ilib:test test/minitest/test_minitest_test.rb --help
    minitest options:
        -h, --help                       Display this help.
        -s, --seed SEED                  Sets random seed. Also via env. Eg: SEED=n rake
        -v, --verbose                    Verbose. Show progress processing files.
        -n, --name PATTERN               Filter run on /regexp/ or string.
        -e, --exclude PATTERN            Exclude /regexp/ or string from run.

    Known extensions: pride, autotest
        -p, --pride                      Pride. Show your testing pride!
        -a, --autotest                   Connect to autotest server.

== Writing Extensions

To define a plugin, add a file named minitest/XXX_plugin.rb to your
project/gem. That file must be discoverable via ruby's LOAD_PATH (via
rubygems or otherwise). Minitest will find and require that file using
Gem.find_files. It will then try to call +plugin_XXX_init+ during
startup. The option processor will also try to call +plugin_XXX_options+
passing the OptionParser instance and the current options hash. This
lets you register your own command-line options. Here's a totally
bogus example:

    # minitest/bogus_plugin.rb:

    module Minitest
      def self.plugin_bogus_options(opts, options)
        opts.on "--myci", "Report results to my CI" do
          options[:myci] = true
          options[:myci_addr] = get_myci_addr
          options[:myci_port] = get_myci_port
        end
      end

      def self.plugin_bogus_init(options)
        self.reporter << MyCI.new(options) if options[:myci]
      end
    end

=== Adding custom reporters

Minitest uses composite reporter to output test results using multiple
reporter instances. You can add new reporters to the composite during
the init_plugins phase. As we saw in +plugin_bogus_init+ above, you
simply add your reporter instance to the composite via <tt><<</tt>.

+AbstractReporter+ defines the API for reporters. You may subclass it
and override any method you want to achieve your desired behavior.

start   :: Called when the run has started.
record  :: Called for each result, passed or otherwise.
report  :: Called at the end of the run.
passed? :: Called to see if you detected any problems.

Using our example above, here is how we might implement MyCI:

    # minitest/bogus_plugin.rb

    module Minitest
      class MyCI < AbstractReporter
        attr_accessor :results, :addr, :port

        def initialize options
          self.results = []
          self.addr = options[:myci_addr]
          self.port = options[:myci_port]
        end

        def record result
          self.results << result
        end

        def report
          CI.connect(addr, port).send_results self.results
        end
      end

      # code from above...
    end

== FAQ

=== How to test SimpleDelegates?

The following implementation and test:

    class Worker < SimpleDelegator
      def work
      end
    end

    describe Worker do
      before do
        @worker = Worker.new(Object.new)
      end

      it "must respond to work" do
        @worker.must_respond_to :work
      end
    end

outputs a failure:

      1) Failure:
    Worker#test_0001_must respond to work [bug11.rb:16]:
    Expected #<Object:0x007f9e7184f0a0> (Object) to respond to #work.

Worker is a SimpleDelegate which in 1.9+ is a subclass of BasicObject.
Expectations are put on Object (one level down) so the Worker
(SimpleDelegate) hits +method_missing+ and delegates down to the
+Object.new+ instance. That object doesn't respond to work so the test
fails.

You can bypass <tt>SimpleDelegate#method_missing</tt> by extending the worker
with <tt>Minitest::Expectations</tt>. You can either do that in your setup at
the instance level, like:

    before do
      @worker = Worker.new(Object.new)
      @worker.extend Minitest::Expectations
    end

or you can extend the Worker class (within the test file!), like:

    class Worker
      include ::Minitest::Expectations
    end

=== How to share code across test classes?

Use a module. That's exactly what they're for:

    module UsefulStuff
      def useful_method
        # ...
      end
    end

    describe Blah do
      include UsefulStuff

      def test_whatever
        # useful_method available here
      end
    end

Remember, +describe+ simply creates test classes. It's just ruby at
the end of the day and all your normal Good Ruby Rules (tm) apply. If
you want to extend your test using setup/teardown via a module, just
make sure you ALWAYS call super. before/after automatically call super
for you, so make sure you don't do it twice.

=== How to run code before a group of tests?

Use a constant with begin...end like this:

  describe Blah do
    SETUP = begin
       # ... this runs once when describe Blah starts
    end
    # ...
  end

This can be useful for expensive initializations or sharing state.
Remember, this is just ruby code, so you need to make sure this
technique and sharing state doesn't interfere with your tests.

=== Why am I seeing <tt>uninitialized constant MiniTest::Test (NameError)</tt>?

Are you running the test with Bundler (e.g. via <tt>bundle exec</tt> )? If so,
in order to require minitest, you must first add the <tt>gem 'minitest'</tt>
to your Gemfile and run +bundle+. Once it's installed, you should be
able to require minitest and run your tests.

== Prominent Projects using Minitest:

* arel
* journey
* mime-types
* nokogiri
* rails (active_support et al)
* rake
* rdoc
* ...and of course, everything from seattle.rb...

== Developing Minitest:

=== Minitest's own tests require UTF-8 external encoding.

This is a common problem in Windows, where the default external Encoding is
often CP850, but can affect any platform.
Minitest can run test suites using any Encoding, but to run Minitest's
own tests you must have a default external Encoding of UTF-8.

If your encoding is wrong, you'll see errors like:

    --- expected
    +++ actual
    @@ -1,2 +1,3 @@
     # encoding: UTF-8
     -"Expected /\\w+/ to not match \"blah blah blah\"."
     +"Expected /\\w+/ to not match # encoding: UTF-8
     +\"blah blah blah\"."

To check your current encoding, run:

    ruby -e 'puts Encoding.default_external'

If your output is something other than UTF-8, you can set the RUBYOPTS
env variable to a value of '-Eutf-8'. Something like:

    RUBYOPT='-Eutf-8' ruby -e 'puts Encoding.default_external'

Check your OS/shell documentation for the precise syntax (the above
will not work on a basic Windows CMD prompt, look for the SET command).
Once you've got it successfully outputing UTF-8, use the same setting
when running rake in Minitest.

=== Minitest's own tests require GNU (or similar) diff.

This is also a problem primarily affecting Windows developers. PowerShell
has a command called diff, but it is not suitable for use with Minitest.

If you see failures like either of these, you are probably missing diff tool:

      4) Failure:
    TestMinitestUnitTestCase#test_assert_equal_different_long [D:/ruby/seattlerb/minitest/test/minitest/test_minitest_test.rb:936]:
    Expected: "--- expected\n+++ actual\n@@ -1 +1 @@\n-\"hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\"\n+\"blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah\"\n"
      Actual: "Expected: \"hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha\"\n  Actual: \"blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah\""


      5) Failure:
    TestMinitestUnitTestCase#test_assert_equal_different_collection_hash_hex_invisible [D:/ruby/seattlerb/minitest/test/minitest/test_minitest_test.rb:845]:
    Expected: "No visible difference in the Hash#inspect output.\nYou should look at the implementation of #== on Hash or its members.\n
    {1=>#<Object:0xXXXXXX>}"
      Actual: "Expected: {1=>#<Object:0x00000003ba0470>}\n  Actual: {1=>#<Object:0x00000003ba0448>}"


If you use Cygwin or MSYS2 or similar there are packages that include a
GNU diff for Windows. If you don't, you can download GNU diffutils from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/diffutils.htm
(make sure to add it to your PATH).

You can make sure it's installed and path is configured properly with:

    diff.exe -v

There are multiple lines of output, the first should be something like:

    diff (GNU diffutils) 2.8.1

If you are using PowerShell make sure you run diff.exe, not just diff,
which will invoke the PowerShell built in function.

== Minitest related goods

* minitest/pride fabric: http://www.spoonflower.com/fabric/3928730-again-by-katie_allen

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Ruby 1.8.7+. No magic is involved. I hope.
* NOTE: 1.8 and 1.9 will be dropped in minitest 6+.

== INSTALL:

  sudo gem install minitest

On 1.9, you already have it. To get newer candy you can still install
the gem, and then requiring "minitest/autorun" should automatically
pull it in. If not, you'll need to do it yourself:

  gem "minitest"     # ensures you"re using the gem, and not the built-in MT
  require "minitest/autorun"

  # ... usual testing stuffs ...

DO NOTE: There is a serious problem with the way that ruby 1.9/2.0
packages their own gems. They install a gem specification file, but
don't install the gem contents in the gem path. This messes up
Gem.find_files and many other things (gem which, gem contents, etc).

Just install minitest as a gem for real and you'll be happier.
