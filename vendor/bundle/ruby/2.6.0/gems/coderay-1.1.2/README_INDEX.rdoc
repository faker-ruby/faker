= CodeRay

Tired of blue'n'gray? Try the original version of this documentation on
coderay.rubychan.de[http://coderay.rubychan.de/doc/] :-)

== About

CodeRay is a Ruby library for syntax highlighting.

You put your code in, and you get it back colored; Keywords, strings,
floats, comments - all in different colors. And with line numbers.

*Syntax* *Highlighting*...
* makes code easier to read and maintain
* lets you detect syntax errors faster
* helps you to understand the syntax of a language
* looks nice
* is what everybody wants to have on their website
* solves all your problems and makes the girls run after you


== Installation

 % gem install coderay


=== Dependencies

CodeRay needs Ruby 1.8.7+ or 1.9.2+. It also runs on Rubinius and JRuby.


== Example Usage

 require 'coderay'
 
 html = CodeRay.scan("puts 'Hello, world!'", :ruby).div(:line_numbers => :table)


== Documentation

See CodeRay.


== Credits

=== Special Thanks to

* licenser (Heinz N. Gies) for ending my QBasic career, inventing the Coder
  project and the input/output plugin system.
  CodeRay would not exist without him.
* bovi (Daniel Bovensiepen) for helping me out on various occasions.

=== Thanks to

* Caleb Clausen for writing RubyLexer (see
  http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubylexer) and lots of very interesting mail
  traffic
* birkenfeld (Georg Brandl) and mitsuhiku (Arnim Ronacher) for PyKleur, now pygments.
  You guys rock!
* Jamis Buck for writing Syntax (see http://rubyforge.org/projects/syntax)
  I got some useful ideas from it.
* Doug Kearns and everyone else who worked on ruby.vim - it not only helped me
  coding CodeRay, but also gave me a wonderful target to reach for the Ruby
  scanner.

* iGEL, magichisoka, manveru, WoNÃ¡Do and everyone I forgot from rubyforen.de
* Dethix from ruby-mine.de
* zickzackw
* Dookie (who is no longer with us...) and Leonidas from http://www.python-forum.de
* Andreas Schwarz for finding out that CaseIgnoringWordList was not case

=== Free

* As you can see, CodeRay was created under heavy use of *free* software.

* If you use CodeRay to create software, think about making this software
  *free*, too.
* Thanks :)
