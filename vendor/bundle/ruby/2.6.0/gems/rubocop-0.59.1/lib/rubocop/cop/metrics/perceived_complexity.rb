      # This cop tries to produce a complexity score that's a measure of the
      # complexity the reader experiences when looking at a method. For that
      # reason it considers `when` nodes as something that doesn't add as much
      # complexity as an `if` or a `&&`. Except if it's one of those special
      # `case`/`when` constructs where there's no expression after `case`. Then
      # the cop treats it as an `if`/`elsif`/`elsif`... and lets all the `when`
      # nodes count. In contrast to the CyclomaticComplexity cop, this cop
      # considers `else` nodes as adding complexity.
      #
      # @example
      #
      #   def my_method                   # 1
      #     if cond                       # 1
      #       case var                    # 2 (0.8 + 4 * 0.2, rounded)
      #       when 1 then func_one
      #       when 2 then func_two
      #       when 3 then func_three
      #       when 4..10 then func_other
      #       end
      #     else                          # 1
      #       do_something until a && b   # 2
      #     end                           # ===
