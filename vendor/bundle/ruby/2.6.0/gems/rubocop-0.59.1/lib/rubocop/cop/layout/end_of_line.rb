      # @example EnforcedStyle: native (default)
      #   # The `native` style means that CR+LF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) is
      #   # enforced on Windows, and LF is enforced on other platforms.
      #
      #   # bad
      #   puts 'Hello' # Return character is LF on Windows.
      #   puts 'Hello' # Return character is CR+LF on other than Windows.
      #
      #   # good
      #   puts 'Hello' # Return character is CR+LF on Windows.
      #   puts 'Hello' # Return character is LF on other than Windows.
      #
      # @example EnforcedStyle: lf
      #   # The `lf` style means that LF (Line Feed) is enforced on
      #   # all platforms.
      #
      #   # bad
      #   puts 'Hello' # Return character is CR+LF on all platfoms.
      #
      #   # good
      #   puts 'Hello' # Return character is LF on all platfoms.
      #
      # @example EnforcedStyle: crlf
      #   # The `crlf` style means that CR+LF (Carriage Return + Line Feed) is
      #   # enforced on all platforms.
      #
      #   # bad
