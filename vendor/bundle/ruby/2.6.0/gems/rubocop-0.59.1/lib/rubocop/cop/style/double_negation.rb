      # This cop checks for uses of double negation (!!) to convert something
      # to a boolean value. As this is both cryptic and usually redundant, it
      # should be avoided.
      #
      # @example
      #
      #   # bad
      #   !!something
      #
      #   # good
      #   !something.nil?
      #
      # Please, note that when something is a boolean value
      # !!something and !something.nil? are not the same thing.
      # As you're unlikely to write code that can accept values of any type
      # this is rarely a problem in practice.
