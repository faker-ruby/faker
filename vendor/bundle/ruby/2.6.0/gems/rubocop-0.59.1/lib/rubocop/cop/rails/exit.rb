      # This cop enforces that 'exit' calls are not used within a rails app.
      # Valid options are instead to raise an error, break, return or some
      # other form of stopping execution of current request.
      #
      # There are two obvious cases where 'exit' is particularly harmful:
      #
      # - Usage in library code for your application. Even though rails will
      # rescue from a SystemExit and continue on, unit testing that library
      # code will result in specs exiting (potentially silently if exit(0)
      # is used.)
      # - Usage in application code outside of the web process could result in
      # the program exiting, which could result in the code failing to run and
      # do its job.
      #
      # @example
      #   # bad
      #   exit(0)
      #
      #   # good
      #   raise 'a bad error has happened'
