### Maintaining Faker

As maintainers of the gem, this is our guide. Most of the steps and guidelines in the Contributing document apply here, including how to set up your environment, write code to fit the code style, run tests, craft commits and manage branches. Beyond this, this document provides some details that would be too low-level for contributors.

For those of you with commit access, please check out Scott Chacon's blog post about [github flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)

> * Anything in the main branch is deployable
> * To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of main (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)
> * Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
> * When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
> * After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into main

If you're reviewing a PR, you should ask yourself:
> * Does it work as described? A PR should have a great description.
> * Is it understandable?
> * Is it well implemented?
> * Is it well tested?
> * Is it well documented?
> * Is it following the structure of the project?
