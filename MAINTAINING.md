### Maintaining Faker

As maintainers of the gem, this is our guide. Most of the steps and guidelines in the Contributing document apply here, including how to set up your environment, write code to fit the code style, run tests, craft commits and manage branches. Beyond this, this document provides some details that would be too low-level for contributors.

If you're reviewing a PR, you should ask yourself:
> * Does it work as described? A PR should have a great description.
> * Is it understandable?
> * Is it well implemented?
> * Is it well tested?
> * Is it well documented?
> * Is it following the structure of the project?
