      quote:
        - "There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man."
        - "It's like everyone tells a story about themselves inside their own head. Always. All the time. That story makes you what you are. We build ourselves out of that story."
        - "Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts."
        - "Half of seeming clever is keeping your mouth shut at the right times."
        - "We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing because. That's as easy as putting a penny in your pocket. But to love something despite. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect."
        - "Bones mend. Regret stays with you forever."
        - "Books are a poor substitute for female companionship, but they are easier to find."
        - "Only priests and fools are fearless and I've never been on the best of terms with God."
        - "The boy grows upward, but the girl grows up."
