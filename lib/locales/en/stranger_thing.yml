      "I just didn’t want you to think I was such a wastoid, you know?",
      "You’re going to take out the demigorgon with a slingshot?",
      "Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.",
      "Eggos?",
      "This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone.",
      "My God, is she Russian?",
      "Maybe I’m crazy, maybe I’m out of my mind! But God help me, I will keep these lights up until the day I die if I think there’s a chance that Will’s still out there!",
      "Am I dreaming, or is that you, Harrington?",
      "How do you know it’s not just a lizard?....Because his face opened up and he ate my cat!",
      "Use the shampoo and conditioner and when your hair’s damp, not wet, okay? When it’s damp, you do four puffs of the Farrah Fawcett spray.",
      "She will not be able to resist these pearls. *Purrs*",
      "So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out?",
      "I don’t want you to get hurt at all. And I don’t wanna lose you. Just make sure you heat up some real food. Not just Eggos."
