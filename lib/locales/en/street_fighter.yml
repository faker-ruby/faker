          - Did you see that, Daddy? I'm gonna fix our dojo up good!
          - Yeah! Looks like my moves work just as well on real world opponents!
          - I know I'm still young, but fighters in training really have the desire to win!
          - I'm gonna keep winning like this and get stronger and stronger!
          - Whoah! You're pretty strong!
          - You just haven't trained enough. You may as well quit the tournament now.
          - You're to weak to use your loss to promote my dojo...
          - I knew exactly what you'd try! Better luck next time!
          - Don't underestimate me!
          - Didja see that?
          - True power is not just physical. Still, that hurt, didn't it?
          - I have inflicted no grave injuries. Go now and recover.
          - I used to think of this power as a curse, but now I appreciate it.
          - I believe in the power of humanity.
          - I'm so tired... I can hardly wait to relax with a nice bubble bath.
          - That's all for today's lesson.
          - I sense a strength within you. We will meet again.
          - Victory is mine, but there is always next time. Shall I foresee the outcome?
          - You are not cut out to be a fighter. It would be wise to seek another path.
          - Embrace your destiny.
          - Are you hurt?
          - Man, I've gotten so famous lately that I can't even walk around outside anymore without people tryin' to ask for my autograph! I'm thinkin' maybe I need a bodyguard or somethin'! For real!
          - So I was wonderin'... What's the difference between an ocean an' a sea, anyway? Is it just about size? Does the location matter? Can a sea get promoted to an ocean if it tries really hard?
          - There ain't nothin I like more than a nice custom bike. It ain't just about the obvious stuff like color and shape, either. Ya gotta worry about the overall balance an' make sure it looks...
          - I drove to China on my bike the other day. What? I ain't lyin', man! I never lie! I totally drove there on my bike! Don't belive me? Check a map! I'll retrace my steps for ya!
          - Hobbies? Karaoke, baby! Can't get enough of it! One time Candy an' me, we rented out a karaoke box for a whole week! That was a blast! We're still payin' the owner for the busted speakers...
          - I ain't just a legend in the fighting world, ya know. I'm also well-known in biker circles! Prolly considered the top biker in America! But I got my sights set even higher! One day, I'll...
          - Candy's really into gardening lately. Ya know those little onion-lookin' things? They kinda look like me? Oh yeah! Bulbs! So, she planted a buncha bulbs in the garden, see? An' before long...
          - Wanna know what I like most about Candy? Too bad! That's top secret privileged information, bub! I don't want you fallin' in love with her, too! Not that you could compete, but still...
          - Why do women take so long to shop, anyway? Don't tell Candy I said this, but that girl took like 2 hours to decide between a couple of blouses that were the exact same color! No difference!
          - Wataaah!
          - Achoo!
          - My journey to become the ultimate fighter has only just begun.
          - Each time I fight, I learn something new. This journey has been fruitful.
          - Even if my fists were to turn to dust, I would not give up in my quest!
          - The more I learn, the more I realize how far I am from the end of my journey.
          - The power I am after is the power to win - not the power to destroy!
          - You must defeat my Shoryuken to stand a chance!
          - No need to speak. Your fists told me everything I need to know about you.
          - If you go into the ring expecting to fail, you will. Believe in yourself!
          - Power alone is no guarantee of victory. Keep your eyes on your opponent!
          - Give it your all!
          - These two fists are everything to me!
          - Do not place so much importance on winning. The fight itself has value.
          - A strong fighter is not one who always wins, but one who stands after defeat.
          - All the worlds fighters must bow before the undisputed king!
          - I'm inspired by the courage of those who have fallen before my mighty fist.
          - I will not rest until I know the meaning of the fight!
          - They call me the king for a reason fool! You never stood a chance!
          - Have you tested him in battle as well? Impressive, I shall remember you.
          - You are not strong enough to go toe to toe with the undisputed king!
          - You are not a warrior, you're a beginner.
          - Stand up!
          - Now you know the power of the king!
          - Training is fun if you set your mind to a specific goal to work toward!
          - Yes! I'm doing great! Gotta keep this up!
          - Awesome fight! I'm on top of my game today!
          - Oh no! I almost forgot I'm s'posed to meet Kei today! I'm gonna be late!
          - I got some kind of invitation in the mail from Karin. I'd better reply!
          - Yeah! That was great!
          - That was so fun! We have to do it again soon!
          - Phew! That was a close one! Wanna go again?
          - You're pretty strong, but you need to mix up your moves a bit more.
          - Thanks for fighting me!
          - That's a wrap!
          - Evil? Like the concept of gods, this is a meaningless human construct.
          - No need to contemplate your future. That is for me to determine. Not you.
          - My name, my consciousness, my power...Everything I have, I earned for myself!
          - I was just looking for a test subject to assist in augmenting my engine...
          - Before long, a new age will dawn upon the earth and I shall rule over all!
          - Fear in the face of such power is only natural. No need to hide it.
          - I am impressed. Now stand so that I may assimilate your data!
          - I did not expect you to put up such a fight. You have impressed me.
          - This has been a complete waste of time. Prepare for data deletion!
          - My name is Seth. Remember it!
          - I am ruler of all I survey!
          - You cannot defeat me if you fight only for yourself.
          - These fists fight for life. They are protected by benevolent spirits.
          - Let us go to the ends of the earth!
          - True warriors know no fear. This is not pride, but merely confidence.
          - My power is bestowed upon me by the spirits. You have no such power!
          - Spirits and men are both engaged in a constant journey.
          - I do not fear death. But do not confuse this for resignation.
          - Do not lament over your loss, for the spirits will heal and rejuvenate you.
          - I will not stop until I have found my beloved and hold her in my arms!
          - Let us depart.
          - The wind speaks to us.
          - No one compares to my beauty. Nor my strength.
          - Not even the gods could create something that compares to my beauty.
          - Blood is the most beautiful color known to mankind.
          - Power and wealth are meaningless in the face of blinding beauty.
          - I look the most beautiful when glimpsed in the moment of your demise.
          - I am at my most beautiful when I am dealing the victory blow.
          - The least I could do is defeat you with unmatched beauty and grace.
          - Fighting ugly opponents depresses me to no end.
          - The weak have nothing to offer and should be culled from the population.
          - I am beautiful.
          - Victory is beautiful.
          - Choosing to fight me means that you are prepared to face defeat!
          - My muscles are my shield and this shield can withstand any attack!
          - Compared to my training in Siberia, street fights are mere child's play!
          - Fans are what drive a wrestler's spirit! With support from my fans, I can't lose!
          - If you want to build your leg muscles, you should try the Cossack Dance!
          - I am the Red Cylcone and I destroy anything in my path!
          - You'd better not try to stand up right away. I threw you awfully hard...
          - That last move was impressive, comrade. But it was too little, too late!
          - You need more muscle mass!
          - You have to want victory!
          - Khorosho I win!
