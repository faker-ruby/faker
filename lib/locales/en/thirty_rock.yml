      business_advice:
        - Well, it's business drunk. It's like rich drunk. Either way, it's legal to
          drive.
        - Ambition is the willingness to kill the things you love and eat them in order
          to stay alive. Haven't you ever read my throw pillow?
        - If you make enough money you can pay people to look at you naked.
        - I get my hair cut every two days, after all your hair is your head suit.
        - What do we elites do when we screw up? We pretend it never happened and give
          ourselves a giant bonus.
        - Letting morality get in the way of making money? I might as well go and be
          a teacher.
        - He's on LinkedIn, Lemon, he might as well be dead!
        - There are no bad ideas. Just good ideas that go horribly bad.
        - Rich 50 is middle-class 38.
        - The imaginary enemy. Classic move, Lemon. The Salem Witch Trials, the Red
          scare, global warming.
        - I believe that when you have a problem, you talk it over with your priest,
          or your tailor, or the mute elevator porter at your men's club. Then you take
          that problem and you crush it with your mind vice. But for lesser beings,
          like curly haired men and people who need glasses, therapy can help.
        - "Factories provide three things this country desperately needs: jobs, pride,
          and material for Bruce Springsteen songs."
        - We are an immigrant nation. The first generation works their fingers to the
          bone making things; the next generation goes to college and innovates new
          ideas. The third generation snowboards and takes improv classes.
        - Making it through a full 24 hours without making a single misstep is called
          Reaganing. The only other people who've ever done it? Lee Iacocca, Jack Welch
          and — no judgment — Saddam Hussein.
        - Nothing brings a team together like a harrowing experience.
        - I don't choose my mentees lightly. They have to have the drive and ambition
          to be worth my time. The intelligence to understand the challenges they're
          going to face. The humility to accept my help. And finally, a life that is
          a bottomless swamp of chaos. Drive, intelligence, humility, chaos, or the
          acryonym DIHC.
        - Money can't buy happiness. It IS happiness.
        - I am 'innoventing'. A word that I just 'innovented'.
        - There's always an untapped market. Don was the one who realized there was
          a whole segment of consumers not buying light bulbs. The asleep. That realization
          led him to develop the nightlight and the marketing campaign aimed at making
          children afraid of the dark. 'A monster under every bed.'
        - Don said that no business is ever done evolving. That there are always opportunities
          for innovation.
        - I never sleep on planes, I don't want to get incepted.
        - Not thinking is what makes America great.
        - Not everyone is cut out to be a business man. For example, curly-haired men
          or people who need glasses.
        - I know this sounds ugly but in Manhattan real estate there are no rules, it's
          like check-in at an Italian airport.
        - Pete, did you know that men with full heads of hair, on average, earn 17 percent
          more than their bald counterparts.
        - We all have ways of coping. I use sex, and awesomeness.
        - Every time I meet a new person, I figure out how I'm gonna fight 'em.
        - Men seek out the company of other men they admire and want to be like. Floyd
          is me 20 years ago, I'm Don Geiss 30 years ago. 20 years from now, Floyd'll
          be me, I'm gonna be Don Geiss and Don Geiss will be dead.

        - Somebody bring me some ham.
        - Those shoes are definitely bi-curious.
        - Boy, it's crazy to think we used to settle questions of paternity by dunking
          a woman in water until she admitted she made it all up. Different time, the
          '60s.
        - I'm not a creative type like you, with your work sneakers and left-handedness.
        - Lemon, women your age are more likely to get mauled at the zoo than get married.
        - Stop eating people's old French fries, pigeon! Have some self respect! Don't
          you know you can fly?

          here?
        - I do not want to disappoint our Japanese public, especially Godzilla. Hahaha!
          I'm just kidding, I know he doesn't care what humans do.

        - If reality TV has taught us anything, it's that you can't keep people with
          no shame down.
        - Hey, nerds! Who's got two thumbs, speaks limited French, and hasn't cried
          once today? This moi.
        - Donuts and bed? What are you depressed about, or celebrating?
        - I really don't think it's fair for me to be on a jury since I'm a hologram.
        - But why would you want to cut your hair? You look exactly as I imagine Mary
          Magadalene to be.
        - Go to Disneyland? Lemon, I've held Walt Disney's frozen head in my hands.
        - Lizzing is a combination of laughing and whizzing.
        - Yes, the rest of us talked about it last night at Finnegan's, the bar we go
          to after work. In my dreams.
        - We have a show tonight. I've never missed a show. Not even the time I had
          that virus they kept saying only raccoons get.
        - You're wise, Liz Lemon. Like a genetically-manipulated shark.
        - "If I have learned anything from my SIMS family: When a child doesn't see his
          father enough he starts to jump up and down, then his mood level will drop
          until he pees himself."
        - Which one is the elevator I'm not afraid of?
        - When the Parcells first came to America, they lived in a town called Sexcriminalboat.
        - Global warming? Sorry, sir, that's just scientist talk. The same people who
          say my grandfather was a monkey. If that's true, why was he killed by a monkey?
        - I know it's a girl, Liz Lemon, because I yelled out 'Susan B. Anthony' at
          the moment of conception.
        - For four years I've had to make do with what passes for men around here, with
          their untucked shirts, boneless faces, their Stars, both Wars and Trek.
        - There ain't no party like a Liz Lemon party 'cause a Liz Lemon party is mandatory!
        - Trying on jeans is my favorite thing. Maybe later I can get a pap smear from
          an old male doctor.
        - That is actually my thoughtful window staring place. Visitors can go over
          here.
        - I gotta stay serious. From now on the only movies Tracy Jordan makes are about
          the Holocaust, Georgia O'Keeffe, or both.
        - Michael Kors is a friend—we own a gay racehorse together—and I convinced him
          to make wizard cloaks fashionable this winter.
        - I can talk to animals. Well not talk to 'em. I can take commands from them.
        - Do you need sex advice? Here's a tip. Sometimes a lady likes to leave her
          blazer on.
        - I want to roll my eyes right now, but the doctor says that if I keep doing
          it, my ocular muscles might spasm and eject my eyeballs.
        - I'm still smart enough to know that I'll never do better than you Liz Lemon,
          cause you're a cook in the bedroom and a whore in the kitchen.
        - Now I'm heading home for a nooner, which is what I call having pancakes for
          lunch.
        - It's an old Parcell family recipe, but I like to replace the Union soldier
          meat with boiled potatoes.
        - Come on Donaghy. You've skied Mount St. Helens, made eye contact with Michelle
          Bachman, been trapped under a boulder for 128 hours, you're not scared of
          anything.
        - "I'm gonna say to you what I say to all my sharks right before they die: Let's
          go outside."
        - You know what they say boys. If you can't stand the heat, get off of Mickey
          Rourke's sex grill.
        - If you're ordering me an edible arrangement to say thanks, I'd prefer a meat
          one.

          need tar or nicotine.
        - You look like that flashcard they told me means sadness.
        - Science is my most favorite subject, especially the Old Testament.
        - TGS with Tracy Jordan without Tracy Jordan is an oxymoron, like 'liberal government'
          or 'female scientist'.
        - Relationships are like sharks, Liz. if you're not left with several bite marks
          after intercourse, then something's wrong.
        - Lemon, you look terrible, and I once watched you eat oysters while you had
          a cold.
        - Good God, Lemon, your breath! When did you find time to eat a diaper you found
          on the beach?
        - I like when a woman has ambition. It's like seeing a dog wearing clothes.
        - I like you. You have the boldness of a much younger woman.
        - You're Liz Lemon, dammit. In certain lights you're an 'eight,' using East
          Coast Over Thirty-Five standards, excluding Miami.
        - And she always wears high heels, because, according to her, flat shoes are
          for quitters.
        - I appreciate that, Lemon, but if you ever speak ill of Reagan again, I will
          smack those teeth straight.
        - I don't know how, but you're gonna get me another sandwich. Or I'm gonna cut
          your face up so bad you'll have a chin! You'll all have chins!
        - I don't vote Republican or Democrat. Choosing is a sin, so I always just write
          in the Lord's name!
        - Men need alcohol. It gives us the ability to hit on women and then later when
          we're married, to tune them out.
        - I would think that the single woman’s biggest worry would be choking to death
          in her apartment.'
        - "So, here's some advice I wish I woulda got when I was your age: Live every
          week like it's Shark Week."
        - "It's after 6:00. What am I, a farmer?"
        - Oh, poor baby. Can't hack it in the big city? Gonna move to the bay area now,
          pretend that that was your dream the whole time? Have fun always carrying
          a light sweater.
