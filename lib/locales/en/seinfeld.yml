I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian.", "You're gonna over-dry your laundry.", "This isn't a good time.", "That’s the true spirit of Christmas; people being helped by people other than me.", "You’re becoming one of the glitterati.", "Father, I’ve never done this before, so I’m not sure about what I’m supposed to do.", "She’s one of those low-talkers. You can’t hear a word she’s saying!", "Why do they make the condom packets so hard to open?", "This woman hates me so much, I’m starting to like her.", "I've driven women to lesbianism before, but never a mental institution.", "You know I always wanted to pretend I was an architect", "Borrowing money from a friend is like having sex.

You can’t do it in one push; you gotta rock it back and forth a few times and then it goes over.", "Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun. You don't stare at it. It's too risky.

That’s like an hour.", "Jerry, just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it.", "These pretzels are makin' me thirsty.", "It became very clear to me sitting out there today that every decision I've made in my entire life has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat - it's all been wrong.", "I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me.", "I have been performing feats of strength all morning.", "Hi, my name is George, I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.", "I don't trust the guy.

Three buddies sitting around chewing gum.", "Dolores!", "I'll be back. We'll make out.", "I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm a US postal worker and my mail truck was just ambushed by a band of backwoods mail-hating survivalists.", "You very bad man, Jerry. Very bad man.", "No soup for you!", "Serenity now!", "I'm out there Jerry, and I'm loving every minute of it!", "I'm out of the contest!", "You're killing independent George!", "Not that there's anything wrong with that.", "Yadda, yadda, yadda.", "They're real, and they're spectacular.", "She has man hands.", "And you want to be my latex salesman.", "He's a close talker.", "It's a Festivus for the rest of us.", "I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity.", "You, my friend, have crossed the line between man and bum.", "You were necking during Schindler's List?"]
