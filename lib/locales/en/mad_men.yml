      quotes:
      - Advertising is based on one thing - happiness. And do you know what happiness
        is? Happiness is the smell of a new car. It's freedom from fear. It's a
        billboard on the side of a road that screams with reassurance that whatever
        you're doing is OK. You are OK.
      - Remember Don. When God closes a door he opens a dress.
      - You don't know how to drink. Your whole generation, you drink for the wrong
        reasons. My generation, we drink because it's good, because it feels better
        than unbuttoning your collar, because we deserve it. We drink, because it's
        what men do.
      - But that’s life. One minute you’re on top of the world, the next minute some
        secretary’s running you over with a lawn mower.
      - I have been watching my life. It’s right there. I keep scratching at it, trying
        to get into it. I can’t.
      - No. Because there are people out there who buy things, people like you and
        me. And something happened. Something terrible. And the way that they saw
        themselves is gone. And nobody understands that. But you do. And that’s very
        valuable.
      - People tell you who they are, but we ignore it - because we want them to be
        who we want them to be.
      - The truth is, they’re mourning for their childhood more than they’re anticipating
        their future, because they don’t know it yet, but they don’t want to die.
      - Who knows why people in history did good things? For all we know Jesus was
        trying to get the loaves and fishes account.
      - Who do you think he is? Advertising? Insurance? Lawyer? And who do you think's
        waiting at home? I bet she's not ugly. The only sin she's committed is being
        familiar.
      - I'm just acknowledging that life, unlike this analysis, will eventually end,
        and somebody else will get the bill.
      - No man has ever come back from leave, not even Napoleon.
      - You're hung over, it's the best time to hear it. Are you just gonna kill yourself?
        Give them what they want? Or are you gonna go in your room, put on your uniform,
        fix your bayonet and hit the parade? Do the work, Don.
      - LeaseTech, the company we're leasing the computer from, is a virgin. I think
        we should prepare a presentation while their guy is here and push 'em over
        the edge.
      - If I had my way, you would never advertise. You shouldn't have someone like
        me telling that boy what a Hershey bar is. He already knows.
      - We're conquistadors. I'm Vasco de Gama, you're... some other Mexican. We're
        going to land, buy whatever they've got for the beads in our pockets. Our
        biggest challenge is to not get syphilis.
      - That poor girl. She doesn't know that loving you is the worst way to get to
        you.
