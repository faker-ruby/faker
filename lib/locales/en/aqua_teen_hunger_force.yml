      quote:
        - "Dancing is forbidden!"
        - "Friendship ain't about trust. Friendship's about nunchucks."
        - "Listen to me, Randy. It doesn't matter what you look like on the outside-- whether you're white or black or a sasquatch even-- as long as you follow your dream, no matter how crazy or against the law it is, except for a sasquatch. If you're a sasquatch, the rules are different."

        - "He says that it sounded like my hobbit that turns the crank case is depressed and needs therapy. We need get us a new hobbit. They's from the land beyond time. Land beyond time is also gonna hook us up with a unicorn for the radiator. I ain't even gonna tell ya about that haunted air conditioner. Plus, the air filter? That's made of plutonium. That's gonna involve Superman, so...ya know, plus shipping from Krypton. And the cow..jumped over the moon."
