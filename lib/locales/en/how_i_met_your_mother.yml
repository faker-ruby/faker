       "Ted, how many times have I told you to put the lid back on the peanut butter jar?! It’s this inconsiderate, immature jackassery that makes me feel like I’m living in The Real World House! And not the early days when they all had jobs and social consciences, I’m talking about Hawaii, and after!",
       "There are a lot of little reasons why the big things in our lives happen.",

       "It’s just, eventually we’re all gonna move on. It’s called growing up.",

       "The future is scary but you can’t just run back to the past because it’s familiar.",
       "I realized that I’m searching, searching for what I really want in life. And you know what? I have absolutely no idea what that is.",
       "Revenge fantasies never work out the way you want.",
       "Whether a gesture’s charming or alarming, depends on how it’s received."
