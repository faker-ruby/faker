      lyric:
        - "Paint a perfect picture."
        - "Housequake!"
        - "Only want to see you laughing in the purple rain."
        - "It's been 7 hours and 16 days since you took your love away."
        - "All seven and we watch them fall. They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all with an intellect, and a savoir faire"
        - "It was only last June when her old man ran away. She couldn't stop crying cause she knew he was gone to stay."
        - "But I say, it's only mountains and the sea. Love will conquer if you just believe."
        - "Some say a man ain't happy unless a man truly dies."
        - "The girl on the seesaw is laughing, for love is the color this place imparts."
        - "People call me rude, I wish we all were nude. I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules."
        - "Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me? Some people wanna die so they can be free."
        - "You didn't have the decency to change the sheets."
        - "And they say I'm so shy, yeah, but with you I just go wild!"
        - "How can you just leave me standing alone in a world so cold?"
        - "Don't worry, I won't hurt you... I only want you to have some fun."
        - "Is that your boyfriend? Ha, I don't care."
        - "Piano man, put it where it feel good!"
        - "Rain is wet, and sugar is sweet. Clap your hands, and stomp your feet!"
        - "You're gonna have to fight your own damn war, cause we don't want to fight no more."
        - "You ask me if I love you, it's automatic."
        - "Shut up already, damn!"
        - "There's a brand new groove going 'round, in your funky town, and the kick drum is the fault."
        - "Come on y'all, we got to jam, before the police come. A groove this funky is on the run."
        - "Until the end of time, I'll be there for you."
